"""
Given a positive integer N, your task is to return the number of steps required by the following algorithm to reach N:

    1. Find the smallest triangular number Ti such that Ti â‰¥ N. Build the corresponding list L = [ 1, 2, ..., i ].
    2. While the sum of the terms of L is greater than N, remove the first term from the list.
    3. If the sum of the terms of L is now less than N, increment i and append it to the list. Go on with step #2.

We stop as soon as N is reached. Only the first step is systematically executed. Steps #2 and #3 may not be processed at all.
